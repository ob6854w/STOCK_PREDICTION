# STOCK_PREDICTION
INTRODUCTION
   
   Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult tasks to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction; physical vs. physiological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combined makes share prices volatile and very difficult to predict, with a high degree of accuracy. 
Broadly, stock market analysis is divided into two parts – Fundamental and Technical Analysis.
Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance visualizations, as well as prediction.
Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.
